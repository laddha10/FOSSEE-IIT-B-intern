Submission: Assignment 2 by Sankalp Gupta
Jaipur engineering college & research centre ,jaipur

I tried to attempt Assignment 2 of Part A and also got positive outcome .
I was having neither background of scilab nor Matlab but I explore the basics of Matlab.
Practising from basics to Standard questions ,I got confidence to appear for the test.
Here, in assignment 2 of part A , I uses addme() function in Matlab code .
Learning basics of conversion from mathworks.com, I translated the code to fossee_asgnmnt2.c file .

Then in scilab 5.5.2 ,I direct converted matlab code to scilab code .

Problem : We have to use "coder" library for converting matlab/scilab to .c file which is not available in matlab 7.3(2006) and Latest version was not available from any of the sources available to me .
